"""Criterion: Alerts Center filters and the acknowledge/assign/resolve workflow mutate real state.

Note: the app has no endpoint to create alerts (they are seeded), so this test acts on the
seeded EIN-HGH-0002 alert (not the EIN-CRT-0001 alert relied on by the "exactly 1 critical"
filter assertion). `seed.py` is idempotent and wipes+reinserts, so this is restorable.
